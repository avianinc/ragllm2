# Language Model (LLM) Flask Service

The Language Model Flask Service is a Flask-based application designed to provide an interface for interacting with language models, specifically tailored for mission engineering expert analysis. It utilizes the `langchain_community.embeddings.HuggingFaceEmbeddings` to leverage state-of-the-art language models for generating insights and answering queries within a specified domain.

## Features

- **Query Handling**: Process queries using advanced language models.
- **Insight Generation**: Generate insights based on the context provided to the system.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Ready for deployment in both internet-connected and air-gapped (offline) environments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Flask
- Requests (for environments with internet access)
- Additional Python packages as specified in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed on your system.

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd llm_flask_service
    ```

2. **Setup Python Environment (Optional)**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Environment Configuration**

    For air-gapped systems, ensure all necessary models and dependencies are pre-downloaded and available locally. Set environment variables accordingly:

    ```
    export SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_HOME=/path/to/your/cache
    ```

5. **Running the Application**

    Start the Flask application by running:

    ```
    flask run --host=0.0.0.0
    ```

    For production environments, consider deploying with a WSGI server like Gunicorn.

## Usage

After starting the application, you can send queries to your Flask service via HTTP POST requests:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"query\":\"Your query here\", \"context\": \"Optional context here\"}"
```
### Querying the Flask Service

After starting the application, you can interact with the Flask service by sending queries via HTTP POST requests. Initial queries to start a conversation do not require a `qhid` (Query History ID). The response to an initial query will include a `qhid` that uniquely identifies the query thread. To continue the conversation and maintain context, include this `qhid` in subsequent queries.

#### Initial Query

For the first query in a conversation thread, you only need to provide the `query` and an optional `context`. Here is an example command: 

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "What are the most critical design considerations for reducing the radar cross-section of an aircraft?", "context": "You are developing a new type of aircraft designed to minimize radar cross-section and maximize fuel efficiency."}'
```

Replace `http://localhost:5000/query` with the appropriate URL if deployed on a different host or port.

#### Example Initial Query Response

The response to your initial query will include a `qhid` along with the answer. Here is a typical response:

```json
{
  "qhid": "eff7b2ab-c41d-4db9-bc5d-cc37b60d20ec",
  "response": "Response text with insights on reducing the radar cross-section of an aircraft..."
}
```

#### Continuing the Conversation

To continue the conversation and ensure the context is maintained, include the `qhid` received in the response of your previous query in your next request. Here is an example of how to continue the conversation:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "Can you provide more details on shape optimization?", "context": "Continuing from our previous discussion on aircraft design.", "qhid": "eff7b2ab-c41d-4db9-bc5d-cc37b60d20ec"}'
```

This process allows for a coherent and context-aware conversation with the service, leveraging the power of language models to generate informative and relevant responses based on the ongoing discussion thread.

## Deployment
```
docker build -t ragllm2 .
docker run -p 5000:5000 -p 8888:8888 ragllm2
```
