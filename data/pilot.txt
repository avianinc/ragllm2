Navy Pilot's Feedback
Event Content: 7
Comments: The content was relevant, especially the parts focusing on flight dynamics and mission scenario simulations. More examples related to naval aviation and carrier-based operations would make the event more pertinent.

Welcome Packet: 9
Comments: The welcome packet was informative, providing a good overview of what to expect. A brief section on aviation-specific simulation technologies would be appreciated.

Software: 8
Comments: The visualization software was effective in demonstrating flight simulations and potential real-world applications. Improvements could be made in simulating more complex aerial maneuvers and incorporating variable weather conditions.

Suggestions/Additional Comments: Future events could benefit from including flight simulation software tutorials and expert discussions on emerging technologies in aviation simulation. Additionally, a focus group for naval aviation applications of simulation technologies could foster more specialized discussions.
